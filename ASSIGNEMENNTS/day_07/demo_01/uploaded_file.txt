The preservation of cultural heritage monuments is a critical challenge, particularly in developing countries where documentation resources are limited and many historical structures remain digitally unrecorded. This project proposes a web-based, open-source, and automated platform for the large-scale digital preservation of monuments using crowdsourced images. The system enables tourists, local communities, and experts to upload photographs of heritage sites through a user-friendly web or mobile interface.

The uploaded images are processed through a low-cost, modular backend pipeline that performs metadata extraction, duplicate detection, and visual similarity analysis using perceptual hashing, deep image embeddings, and feature-level matching. Based on this analysis, the system either retrieves an existing 3D model or triggers a new reconstruction process. Open-source photogrammetry tools such as COLMAP and Meshroom are employed to generate raw 3D models from 2D images, which are further optimized using Blender in headless mode to produce web-ready glTF/GLB models.

The optimized 3D models are visualized directly in the browser using Google Model Viewer or Three.js, allowing users to interactively explore monuments through rotation, zooming, and mobile-friendly rendering. Beyond visualization, the platform integrates multilingual textual descriptions, audio narration, and automated video tours, generated using Text-to-Speech, translation APIs, and video processing tools. This enhances accessibility for diverse audiences and promotes inclusive heritage education.

The system is designed to support incremental model improvement, where additional image uploads progressively enhance reconstruction quality. By combining open-source technologies, AI-assisted processing, and multimedia storytelling, the proposed solution provides a scalable and cost-effective framework for the digital preservation, education, and dissemination of cultural heritage monuments at a national and global scale.
